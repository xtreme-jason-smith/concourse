TODO 

	- [x] perform proper `check` in `image_resource` image fetching

	- [x] container state transition

	- [ ] garbage collection of containers

	- [ ] see if we can influence scheduling by putting annotations / labels
	  that identify the builds themselves

	- [ ] get back the exit status of the script executions

	- [ ] put step

	- [ ] test custom resource types

	- [ ] container limits

	- [ ] user in task definition

	- [ ] privileged
		- demonstrate how we're able to go from source to container
		  image without the need of any privileges (that's a very basic
		  thing we should be able to do nowadays)


	- [ ] prepare an issue documenting the work performed, what to do next,
	      the approach, etc

	- [ ] having non-k8s workers together
		- as a user, would you even choose that?

	- [ ] add logs to where it's important to extract info from

	- [ ] multiple namespaces / clusters?
		- argocd: https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/1673
		- [ ] tags?

	- [ ] caches?

	- [ ] fly hijack

	- [ ] fly execute
